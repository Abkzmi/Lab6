### Program description
This is a program that asks the users for how many hours they work, their hourly wage, and what percent of their income they pay in taxes. Then, it prints out both their gross and net pay. 


### How we made this project
We used Jupyter Notebook to make this program.

### How to run
This file could be installed and opened with Jupyter Notebook to be run.

### How to use
When you run the app, it's going to ask you for user's input for 3 things: hours of work, hourly wage, and tax percentage they pay.

### How to contribute
This tax calculator is just a rough estimate for the all states. It is a prototype for now and needs the users input. Asking what state and city the user is from is the next step. Then calculating the tax based on the county they are situated in.
